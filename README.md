# AI Playground

Playground repo for AI vibe-coded projects

This repo is a set of projects that are created by AI engines (usually Claude Code) in a Vibe-coded style. These are typically just prototypes, used for testing different AI code generation techniques.

## Projects

### TypeScript

- **[Stock Gift Value Calculator](typescript/stock-gift-value)** - A React web application that calculates the IRS-approved donated value of stock gifts. Features a full-stack Express backend with Yahoo Finance API integration, comprehensive testing, and CI/CD.

### Python

No projects yet.

## Organization

The top-level folder is the programming language (e.g., `typescript`, `python`) and within each of those folders is a folder per individual project. In some cases these are stand-alone projects, and in other cases, they are sharable libraries. Most projects are just one programming language and are in one folder.

If you are an AI coding agent, start the project by picking the appropriate programming language folder, and create a new subfolder with the project name.
