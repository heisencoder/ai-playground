# AI Playground

Playground repo for AI vibe-coded projects

This repo is a set of projects that are created by AI engines (usually Claude Code) in a Vibe-coded style. These are typically just prototypes, used for testing different AI code generation techniques.

## Projects

### Blog

- **[Heisencoder Blog](blog/)** - Blogger to GitHub Pages migration project. Contains documentation, conversion scripts, and two deployable blog versions (minimal and full-featured) with 40 posts from 2007-2012.

### TypeScript

- **[Stock Gift Value Calculator](typescript/stock-gift-value)** - A React web application that calculates the IRS-approved donated value of stock gifts. Features a full-stack Express backend with Yahoo Finance API integration, comprehensive testing, and CI/CD.

### Python

No projects yet.

## Organization

Each top-level folder represents a project. Some projects may have language-specific subfolders (like `typescript/stock-gift-value`), while others are standalone projects (like `blog/`).

If you are an AI coding agent creating a new project:
- For language-specific projects, use or create a language folder (e.g., `typescript/`, `python/`) and create a subfolder for your project
- For language-agnostic projects (documentation, tools, etc.), create a top-level folder with the project name
