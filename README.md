# AI Playground

Playground repo for AI vibe-coded projects

This repo is a set of projects that are created by AI engines (usually Claude Code) in a Vibe-coded style. These are typically just prototypes, used for testing different AI code generation techniques.

## Projects

- **[Stock Gift Value Calculator](stock-gift-value/)** - A React web application that calculates the IRS-approved donated value of stock gifts. Features a full-stack Express backend with Yahoo Finance API integration, comprehensive testing, and CI/CD.

- **[Heisencoder Blog](blog/)** - Blogger to GitHub Pages migration project. Contains documentation, conversion scripts, and two deployable blog versions (minimal and full-featured) with 40 posts from 2007-2012.

## Organization

Each top-level folder represents a project. Projects are organized by name rather than by programming language.

If you are an AI coding agent creating a new project:
- Create a top-level folder with a descriptive project name (e.g., `my-new-project/`)
- Include a README.md in the project folder describing its purpose and setup
